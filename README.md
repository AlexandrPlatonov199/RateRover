### Requirements: Docker

For running or testing all services you can use `Docker`. You can see instructions for installation
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For running or testing all services you can use `Python` environment. You can install Python on
your local machine directly (see [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) or use any wrappers

**Python version: `3.11` or higher**

After installation Python you need install `poetry` (v1.6.1):
